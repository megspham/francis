Project 4C - Internet of Things Security
CS 111 Winter 2021 - Xu

In this project, we will extend Project 4B to accpet commands to and from a network server over both
unencrypted and encrypted channels. 
    - Primary: Demonstrate the ability to design, build and debug an embedded application that 
    interacts with a central control server with the aid of server-side logs.
    - Primary: Demonstrate the ability to implement a secure channel using standard tools.
    - Primary: Demonstrate the ability to research and exploit a complex API, and to debug an 
    application involving encrypted communication.  

Deliverables:
